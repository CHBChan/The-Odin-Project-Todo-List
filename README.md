# The-Odin-Project-Todo-List

This project was completed in HTML, CSS, and JS for The Odin Project.

This is a simple web application that allows the user to add projects and sub-projects. The user input is saved via localStorage.
I did some light testing and wasn't able to reveal any bugs. There could be obscure bugs present after conducting a more extensive testing procedure.
